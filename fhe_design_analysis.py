The current implementation is essentially a SIMULATION that:
- Stores plaintext embeddings (no encryption)
- Computes on plaintext (no homomorphic operations)
- Uses unnecessary ML models (dot product doesn't need training)
- Has no key management (no public/private keys)
- Has no client/server separation (everything local)

To fix this, you need to:
1. Implement proper key generation
2. Actually encrypt the embeddings
3. Separate client and server code
4. Use simple arithmetic circuits (not ML models)
5. Ensure server never sees plaintext

The patent use case CANNOT be implemented with the current architecture.
